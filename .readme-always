# Lexinum Landing Page - Multi-Agent Scratchpad

This document is the central coordination file for the Lexinum landing page project. It facilitates communication between two roles—**Planner** and **Executor**—to plan, execute, and document all tasks and decisions.

---

## Role Descriptions

### 1. Planner and Agent

**Responsibilities:**
- Perform high-level planning, analysis, and task breakdown.
- Define success criteria and evaluate progress.
- Update this file with planning notes, decisions, and next steps.

**Actions:**
-  (No external tools are used in this WebContainer environment, so planning is done internally.)
- Record all planning outputs in the Multi-Agent Scratchpad below.

### 2. Executor

**Responsibilities:**

- Execute tasks as directed by the Planner.
- Report progress, mark milestones, and raise blockers in the Multi-Agent Scratchpad.
- Provide detailed feedback or request assistance as needed.

**Actions:**

- After completing a task, update the "Current Status / Progress Tracking" section.
- Post any blockers or questions in the "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" section.
- Do not announce final task completion—always seek confirmation from the Planner.

---

## Document Conventions

- **Consistency:** Do not change section headers arbitrarily.
- **Record Keeping:** Append new entries; never delete historical notes.
- **Labeling:** Clearly mark each entry with either "Planner" or "Executor".

---

## Workflow Guidelines

1.  **Initial Setup:**
    -   Update "Background and Motivation" with the project’s overall objectives.
    -   The Planner generates a comprehensive plan.
2.  **Task Execution:**
    -   The Executor carries out tasks as per the plan.
    -   Document progress and note any issues in the designated sections.
3.  **Iterative Coordination:**
    -   Continuously update the document as tasks are completed or new challenges arise.
    -   The cycle of planning and execution continues until the Planner confirms project completion.
4.  **Major Changes:**
    -   Notify the Planner in "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" before implementing significant modifications.

# Multi-Agent Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

**Planner:** The goal is to create a responsive, dark-mode-first landing page for the Lexinum product.  The page should focus on selling the product and driving downloads from the App Store and Google Play.  Key features include a hero section with a 5-second demo video, core messaging ("Switch between numbers and words like a pro."), and prominent CTA buttons. The site should be built with Next.js, and we'll use Storybook for component development. Language auto-detection (EN/ES/JP) is required.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Planner:**
- Ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.
- Implementing language auto-detection correctly.
- Integrating the demo video seamlessly.
- Setting up Storybook and ensuring it works with Tailwind CSS.
- Placeholder assets (video, app store icons) need to be replaced with final assets.

## Verifiable Success Criteria

**Planner:**
- The landing page is fully responsive and displays correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Language auto-detection works, defaulting to English if the user's language isn't EN, ES, or JP.
- The demo video plays correctly (once the placeholder is replaced).
- CTA buttons link to the correct App Store and Google Play URLs (once placeholders are replaced).
- Storybook stories exist for the Hero and CTAButtons components, demonstrating different states (default, hover, different languages).

## High-level Task Breakdown

**Planner:**
1.  Project Initialization (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Storybook).
2.  Create core components (Header, Hero, CTAButtons, Footer).
3.  Implement language detection and translation.
4.  Create Storybook stories.
5.  Add placeholder assets (video, icons).
6.  Refine styling and responsiveness.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Executor:**
- Project initialized with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Storybook.
- Core components (Header, Hero, CTAButtons, Footer) created.
- Language detection and translation implemented.
- Storybook stories created for Hero and CTAButtons.
- Placeholder images and video placeholder added.
- Basic styling applied.
- Google Play icon switched to SVG.
- Attempted to remove app-store-icon.png, but it was already effectively gone.

## Critical Issues and Solutions

**Executor:**
- Storybook installation initially failed due to an I/O error.  Resolved by installing Storybook dependencies explicitly and using an older version.
- Storybook `translate` function error: Resolved by passing the `lang` prop explicitly in Storybook stories.

## Next Steps and Priorities

**Planner:**
1.  **Thoroughly test responsiveness:** Use browser developer tools and Storybook's viewport settings to check different screen sizes.
2.  **Test language detection:**  Simulate different browser language settings to ensure correct behavior.
3.  **Prepare for final assets:**  Document the required dimensions and formats for the demo video and app store icons.
4.  **Consider adding a section below the CTA buttons:** This could showcase additional features or benefits of Lexinum.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Executor:**  None at this time.

## Next Steps and Action Items

**Planner:**
1. Test responsiveness and language detection.
2. Document asset requirements.
3. Design and implement an additional content section.

## Lessons

<!-- Auto-populated development insights. -->
- It's easy to get ahead of oneself and try to remove files that are already effectively gone. Double-check the file system state.
